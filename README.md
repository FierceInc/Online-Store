ShoeFits is an ecommerce website made with React, utilizing a bunch of libraries and tools like Redux, React-router, Firebase and others.

This app I built with the purpose of learning new skills and really solidifying the ones I already know.

I chose react for this project mainly because I didn't feel like I knew enough going into it, and the knowledge I had was very minimal.
Since there is no better learning than project based learning this is one other project I'm proud of but I'm  proud of all my projects
because they were all built as a learning curve. And since I enjoy learning new skill and knowing how tools work.

## These are the tools I got to work with in this project:

- React
- React-Router-Dom
- Redux
- Firebase

## What I got to learn

- Working with routes in react using react-router ( This include hooks like useNavigate, useParams just to name a few )
- Worked alot with built in react hooks
- Redux as a whole and why it's used
- Firebase
- Worked alot with Promises 
- And of course codes splitting, organization and other best practices.

## App is still being built so more on that soon.
